    >Hillshading is shadows drawn on a map to simulate the effect of the sun's rays over the varied terrain of the land.


    >Hillshading is the hypothetical illumination of a surface according to a specified azimuth and altitude for the sun. Hillshading creates a three-dimensional effect that provides a sense of visual relief for cartography, and a relative measure of incident light for analysis.
