    "Pictorial maps are a category of maps that are also loosely called illustrated maps, panoramic maps, perspective maps, birdâ€™s-eye view maps and Geopictorial maps amongst others. In contrast to the regular road map, Atlas or topographic cartography, pictorial maps depict a given territory with a more artistic rather than technical style."
