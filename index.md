title: UX Patterns for Maps
type: index
content: >
    This site presents some [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) for visualizing data on maps and for interacting with it. Each pattern is associated with the problem(s) it solves and with a list of tags easing the navigation across all the patterns. The patterns are being spotted and described by a community of contributors listed on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/ubimix/ux-patterns/blob/master/contributors.md) of the project.
