    >Small multiples are a visualization concept introduced by Edward Tufte. He described them as: “Illustrations of postage-stamp size are indexed by category or a label, sequenced over time like the frames of a movie, or ordered by a quantitative variable not used in the single image itself.”
    
    
    >In other words, small multiples use the same basic graphic or chart to display difference slices of a data set. Small multiples can show rich, multi-dimensional data without trying to cram all that information into a single, overly-complex chart.
